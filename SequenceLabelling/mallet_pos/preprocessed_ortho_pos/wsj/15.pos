can MD

: :
so-called hyph ed JJ
pure JJ

, ,
which WDT

no DT

value NN
in IN

which WDT

not RB
only ly RB
a DT

but CC
also RB
a DT
cash NN
value NN
in IN
the DT

that WDT
can MD
be VB
used ed VBN
in IN
various ous JJ
ways s NNS
while IN

still RB
alive ive JJ

If caps IN
all DT

you PRP
want VBP
is s VBZ
death-benefit hyph JJ
coverage NN
, ,
pure JJ
insurance NN
-- :
a DT
term NN
policy y NN
-- :
gives es VBZ
you PRP
maximum NN
bang NN
for or IN

within IN

It caps PRP
's s VBZ
much RB
cheaper er JJR

bought VBN
at IN
the DT

But caps CC
`` ``

'' ''
means s VBZ
just RB
that DT
; :
the DT
policy y NN
is s VBZ
written en VBN
for or IN
a DT
specific ic JJ
time NN
period NN
only ly RB
and CC
must MD
be VB
renewed ed VBN
when en WRB
it PRP

It caps PRP
may y MD
also RB
stipulate VB
that IN
the DT

must MD
pass s VB
another er DT
medical al JJ
exam NN
before IN

; :
if IN
you PRP
flunk VBP
-- :
which WDT
means s VBZ
you PRP
need ed VBP
insurance NN
more RBR
than IN
ever er RB
-- :
you PRP
may y MD
not RB
be VB
able able JJ

it PRP

Even caps en RB
if IN
you PRP
're VBP

and CC
can MD

, ,
your PRP$

will MD
go VB
up RB
sharply ly RB
because IN

So caps IN
