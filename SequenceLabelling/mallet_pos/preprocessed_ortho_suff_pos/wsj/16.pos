just RB
about IN

that WDT

at IN

the DT

the DT

They y PRP

because IN
they y PRP

That DT

no DT

No DT

at IN

what WP

what WP

Get VB

But CC
the DT

At IN
the DT

while IN

I PRP

then en RB
it PRP
struck VBD

that IN

that IN

`` ``

, ,
why y WRB

the DT

that IN

over er IN

was s VBD
considerably ly RB
less s RBR
severe JJ
. .



Second JJ
, ,
it PRP
explains s VBZ
why y WRB
voters s NNS
hold VBP
Congress s NNP
in IN
disdain NN
but CC
generally ly RB
love VBP
their PRP$

congressional al JJ

: :
Any y DT

's s POS

likewise RB
for or IN
his s PRP$

Third JJ
, ,
the DT
theory y NN
suggests s VBZ
why y WRB

who WP

too RB
much JJ
attention ion NN
to TO
national al JJ

making ing NN
relative ive JJ
to TO
local al JJ
benefit-seeking ing NN
have VBP
lower er JJR
security ity NN
in IN

For or IN
example NN
, ,
first-term JJ
members s NNS
of IN
the DT
House NN
, ,
once RB
the DT
most RBS
vulnerable able JJ
of IN

, ,
have VBP

immune JJ
to TO

The DT
one CD

trend NN
was s VBD
the DT

of IN

by y IN
the DT
Reagan NNP
revolution ion NN
and CC
running ing VBG
for or IN

in IN

Because IN
these DT
freshmen en NNS
placed ed VBD
far RB
more JJR
emphasis s NN
on IN
their PRP$
partisan JJ
role NN
-- :

, ,
they y PRP
were VBD
more RBR

a DT

time NN

a DT

reason NN

why y WRB

To TO

that IN

held VBN
a DT

an DT
especially ly RB
strong JJ
incentive ive NN
to TO

Finally ly RB
, ,
the DT

suggests s VBZ
why y WRB

have VBP
fared ed VBN
better er RBR
in IN

in IN

Since IN

and CC
national al JJ
policy y NN
making ing NN
matters s VBZ
less s RBR
in IN
the DT

of IN

this s DT
is s VBZ
precisely ly RB
the DT
pattern NN

one PRP
would MD
expect VB
if IN
Republicans s NNS
are VBP
less s RBR
willing ing JJ
to TO
engage VB
in IN
local al JJ

than IN
their PRP$
Democratic ic JJ

Is s VBZ
there EX

any y DT
empirical al JJ
support NN
for or IN
this s DT
theory y NN
? .

Three CD
pieces es NNS
of IN

corroborate VBP
the DT

assumption ion NN
that IN

are VBP
more RBR
willing ing JJ
to TO
engage VB
in IN
local al JJ

than IN
their PRP$
Republican JJ
colleagues es NNS

First JJ
, ,
economists s NNS
James es NNP

that IN

roughly ly RB
10 CD
% NN
more JJR
of IN

To TO
the DT
extent NN
that IN
the DT
primary y JJ
duty y NN
of IN
personal al JJ

involves es VBZ
local al JJ
benefit-seeking ing NN
, ,
this s DT
indicates es VBZ
that IN

philosophy y NN
leads s VBZ
congressional al JJ
Republicans s NNS
to TO
pay y VB
less s JJR
attention ion NN
to TO
narrow JJ
constituent NN

. .



Second JJ
, ,
if IN
the DT
key y JJ
assumption ion NN
is s VBZ
valid JJ
, ,
Democrats s NNS
should MD
have VB
lower er JJR
attendance NN

on IN

than IN
Republicans s NNS
do VBP
to TO
the DT
extent NN
that IN
such JJ

and CC
that IN
participating ing VBG
in IN
such JJ

takes es VBZ
away y RB
from IN
the DT

a DT

could MD
otherwise RB
devote VB
to TO
local al JJ

This s DT
is s VBZ
indeed ed RB
what WP

the DT
data NNS

, ,
particularly ly RB
in IN
the DT

of IN
the DT

The DT

Finally ly RB
, ,
as s IN

in IN

, ,
Democrats s NNS
allocate VBP

Holding ing VBG

such JJ

A DT
