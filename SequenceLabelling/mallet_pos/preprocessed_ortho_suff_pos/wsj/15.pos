In IN

yesterday y NN

still RB
differing ing VBG

The DT

came VBD
to TO
a DT

last JJ

When en WRB

Because IN

they y PRP

Mr. NNP

`` ``

he PRP

Typical al JJ
of IN

Mr. NNP
Oriani NNP

his s PRP$

It PRP

it PRP

as s IN
10 CD

Mr. NNP

too RB

that WDT

some DT

that IN

had VBD

Based ed VBN

would MD
have VB

But CC

that WDT

And CC
they y PRP

Over er IN
the DT
past JJ
decade NN
or or CC
two CD
, ,
while IN
I PRP
was s VBD

about IN

the DT

an DT
incredible ible JJ
number er NN
of IN

What WP
to TO
do VB
? .



First RB
, ,
generalize VB
. .

Shorn VBN
of IN
all DT
their PRP$
riders s NNS
, ,
special al JJ
provisions s NNS
, ,
and CC
other er JJ
bells s NNS
and CC
whistles es NNS
, ,
insurance NN
policies ies NNS
can MD
still RB
be VB
grouped ed VBN
under er IN
two CD
broad JJ
categories ies NNS
: :
so-called ed JJ
pure JJ
insurance NN
, ,
which WDT
amasses es VBZ
no DT
cash NN
value NN
in IN
the DT
policy y NN
and CC
pays s VBZ
off RP
only ly RB
upon IN
death NN
, ,
and CC
permanent JJ
insurance NN
, ,
which WDT
provides es VBZ
not RB
only ly RB
a DT
death NN
benefit NN
but CC
also RB
a DT
cash NN
value NN
in IN
the DT
policy y NN

that WDT
can MD
be VB
used ed VBN
in IN
various ous JJ
ways s NNS
while IN
the DT
insured ed VBN
is s VBZ
still RB
alive ive JJ
. .



If IN
all DT

you PRP
want VBP
is s VBZ
death-benefit JJ
coverage NN
, ,
pure JJ
insurance NN
-- :
a DT
term NN
policy y NN
-- :
gives es VBZ
you PRP
maximum NN
bang NN
for or IN
your PRP$
buck NN
, ,
within IN
limits s NNS
. .

It PRP
's s VBZ
much RB
cheaper er JJR
than IN
permanent JJ
insurance NN
bought VBN
at IN
the DT
same JJ
age NN
. .



But CC
`` ``
term NN
'' ''
means s VBZ
just RB
that DT
; :
the DT
policy y NN
is s VBZ
written en VBN
for or IN
a DT
specific ic JJ
time NN
period NN
only ly RB
and CC
must MD
be VB
renewed ed VBN
when en WRB
it PRP
expires es VBZ
. .

It PRP
may y MD
also RB
stipulate VB
that IN
the DT
insured ed NN
must MD
pass s VB
another er DT
medical al JJ
exam NN
before IN
renewal al NN
; :
if IN
you PRP
flunk VBP
-- :
which WDT
means s VBZ
you PRP
need ed VBP
insurance NN
more RBR
than IN
ever er RB
-- :
you PRP
may y MD
not RB
be VB
able able JJ
to TO
buy y VB
it PRP
. .

Even en RB
if IN
you PRP
're VBP
healthy y JJ
and CC
can MD
renew VB
, ,
your PRP$
premium NN
will MD
go VB
up RB
sharply ly RB
because IN
you PRP
're VBP
that DT
much RB
older er JJR
. .

So IN
term NN
insurance NN
may y MD
not RB
be VB
as s RB
cheap JJ
as s IN
it PRP
looks s VBZ
. .



There EX
are VBP
all DT
sorts s NNS
of IN
variations s NNS
on IN
term NN
insurance NN
: :
policies ies NNS
structured ed VBN
to TO
pay y VB
off RP
your PRP$
mortgage NN
debt NN
, ,
term NN
riders s NNS
tacked ed VBD
on IN
to TO
permanent JJ
insurance NN
, ,
and CC
many y JJ
others s NNS
. .

One CD
variation ion NN

that WDT
appealed ed VBD
to TO
me PRP
at IN
first JJ
was s VBD
the DT
`` ``
Money y NNP
Smart NNP
Term NNP
Life NNP
'' ''
policy y NN
offered ed VBN
by y IN
Amex NNP
Life NNP
Insurance NNP
Co. NNP
, ,
the DT
American NNP
Express s NNP
unit NN
, ,
to TO
the DT
parent NN
company y NN
's s POS
credit-card NN
holders s NNS
. .

Upon IN
examination ion NN
, ,
however er RB
, ,
I PRP
wondered ed VBD
whether er IN
the DT
plan NN
made VBD
a DT
lot NN
of IN
sense NN
. .



Amex NNP
said VBD
it PRP
would MD
charge VB
me PRP

$ $
576 CD

a DT
year NN
for or IN
$ $
100,000 CD
of IN
coverage NN
-- :
and CC
would MD
pay y VB
me PRP
back RB
all DT
the DT
premiums s NNS
I PRP
put VBD
in RP
if IN
I PRP
canceled ed VBD
the DT
policy y NN
after er IN
10 CD
years s NNS
. .

Sounds s VBZ
great JJ
-- :
or or CC
does es VBZ
it PRP
? .



First RB
, ,
if IN
I PRP
canceled ed VBD
, ,
I PRP
'd MD
have VB
no DT
more JJR
insurance NN
, ,
a DT
not RB
insignificant JJ
consideration ion NN
. .

Second JJ
, ,
the DT
$ $
5,760 CD

I PRP
'd MD
get VB
back RB
would MD
be VB
much RB
diminished ed VBN
in IN
purchasing ing NN
power er NN
by y IN
10 CD
years s NNS
of IN
inflation ion NN
; :
Amex NNP
, ,
not RB
I PRP
, ,
would MD
get VB
the DT
benefit NN
of IN
the DT
investment ment NN
income NN
on IN
my y PRP$
money y NN
, ,
income NN

that WDT
would MD
have VB
exceeded ed VBN
the DT
inflation ion NN
rate NN
and CC
thus s RB
given en VBN
the DT
company y NN

a DT
real al JJ
profit NN
. .



Third JJ
and CC
most RBS
important JJ
, ,
Amex NNP
would MD
charge VB
me PRP

a DT
far RB
higher er JJR
premium NN
than IN
other er JJ
reputable able JJ
companies ies NNS
would MD
on IN
a DT
straight JJ
term NN
policy y NN
for or IN
the DT
same JJ
amount NN
; :
I PRP
'd MD
be VB
paying ing VBG
so RB
heavily ly RB
just RB
to TO
have VB
the DT
option ion NN
of IN
getting ing VBG
my y PRP$
premiums s NNS
back RB
that IN
I PRP
'd MD
almost RB
have VB
to TO
cancel VB
to TO
make VB
the DT
whole JJ
thing ing NN
worthwhile JJ
. .

That DT
would MD
be VB
all RB
right JJ
with IN
Amex NNP
, ,
which WDT
could MD
then en RB
lock VB
in IN
its s PRP$
investment ment NN
profit NN
, ,
but CC
it PRP
does es VBZ
n't RB
add VB
up RP
to TO
a DT
`` ``
smart JJ
money y NN
'' ''
move NN
for or IN
me PRP
. .



Which WDT
goes es VBZ
to TO
show VB
that IN
the DT
First NNP
Law NNP
applies ies VBZ
in IN
insurance NN
as s IN
in IN
anything ing NN
else RB
: :
There EX
is s VBZ
no DT
free JJ
lunch NN
, ,
there EX
is s VBZ
only ly RB
marketing ing NN
. .



And CC
the DT
Second NNP
Law NNP
, ,
unique JJ
to TO
insurance NN
? .

If IN
I PRP
die VBP
early ly RB
, ,
I PRP
win VBP
-- :
a DT
hollow JJ
victory y NN
, ,
since IN
I PRP
ca MD
n't RB
enjoy y VB
it PRP
-- :
and CC
if IN
I PRP
live ive VBP
long RB
, ,
the DT
insurer er NN
wins s VBZ
. .

Always s RB
. .



This s DT
is s VBZ
worth JJ
remembering ing VBG
when en WRB
insurers s NNS
and CC
their PRP$
salesmen en NNS
try y VBP
to TO
sell VB
you PRP
permanent JJ
insurance NN
, ,
the DT
kind NN

that WDT
amasses es VBZ
cash NN
value NN
. .

The DT
word NN
`` ``
death NN
'' ''
can MD
not RB
be VB
escaped ed VBN
entirely ly RB
by y IN
the DT
industry y NN
, ,
but CC
salesmen en NNS
dodge VBP
it PRP
wherever er WRB
possible ible JJ
or or CC
cloak VBP
it PRP
in IN
euphemisms s NNS
, ,
preferring ing VBG
to TO
talk VB
about IN
`` ``
savings s NNS
'' ''
and CC
`` ``
investment ment NN
'' ''
instead RB
. .

The DT
implication ion NN
is s VBZ
that DT
your PRP$
permanent-insurance JJ
policy y NN
is s VBZ
really ly RB
some DT
kind NN
of IN
CD NNP
or or CC
mutual-fund JJ
account NN
with IN
an DT
added ed VBN
feature NN
. .



That DT
is s VBZ
gilding ing NN
the DT
lily ly NN
. .

The DT
fact NN
is s VBZ
that IN
as s IN
a DT
savings s NNS
or or CC
investment ment NN
vehicle NN
, ,
insurance NN
generally ly RB
runs s VBZ
a DT
poor or JJ
second NN
to TO
any y DT
direct JJ
investment ment NN

you PRP
might MD
make VB
in IN
the DT
same JJ
things s NNS

the DT
insurance NN
company y NN
is s VBZ
putting ing VBG
your PRP$
money y NN
into IN
. .

That DT
's s VBZ
because IN
you PRP
have VBP
to TO
pay y VB
for or IN
the DT
insurance NN
portion ion NN
of IN
the DT
policy y NN
and CC
the DT
effort NN
required ed VBN
to TO
sell VB
and CC
service VB
the DT
whole JJ
package NN
. .

Again RB
, ,
no DT
free JJ
lunch NN
. .



This s DT
is s VBZ
reflected ed VBN
in IN
a DT
built-in JJ
mortality ity NN
cost NN
-- :
in IN
effect NN
, ,
your PRP$
share NN
of IN
the DT
company y NN
's s POS
estimated ed VBN
liability ity NN
in IN
paying ing VBG
off RP
beneficiaries ies NNS
of IN
people NNS

who WP
had VBD
the DT
effrontery y NN
to TO
die VB
while IN
under er IN
its s PRP$
protection ion NN
. .

And CC
in IN
most JJS
cases es NNS
, ,
a DT
huge JJ
hunk NN
of IN
your PRP$
premium NN
in IN
the DT
initial al JJ
year NN
or or CC
two CD
of IN
the DT

the DT
policy y NN
is s VBZ
, ,
in IN
effect NN
, ,
paying ing VBG
the DT
salesman NN
's s POS
commission ion NN
as s RB
well RB
; :
investment ment NN
returns s NNS
on IN
most JJS
policies ies NNS
are VBP
actually ly RB
negative ive JJ
for or IN
several al JJ
years s NNS
, ,
largely ly RB
because IN
of IN
this s DT
. .



So RB
view VB
permanent JJ
insurance NN
for or IN
what WP

it PRP
is s VBZ
-- :
a DT
compromise NN
between en IN
pure JJ
insurance NN
and CC
direct JJ
investment ment NN
. .



The DT
simplest est JJS
, ,
most RBS
traditional al JJ
form NN
of IN
permanent JJ
insurance NN
is s VBZ
the DT
straight JJ
whole JJ
life NN
policy y NN
. .

You PRP
pay y VBP
a DT
set VBN
premium NN
for or IN
a DT
set VBN
amount NN
of IN
coverage NN
, ,
the DT
company y NN
invests s VBZ
that DT
premium NN
in IN
a DT
portfolio NN
of IN
its s PRP$
choosing ing NN
, ,
and CC
your PRP$
cash NN
value NN
and CC
dividends s NNS
grow VBP
over er IN
the DT
years s NNS
. .



One CD
newer er JJR
wrinkle NN
, ,
so RB
called ed VBN
single-premium JJ
life NN
( (
you PRP
pay y VBP
for or IN
the DT
whole JJ
policy y NN
at IN
once RB
) )
, ,
has s VBZ
been en VBN
immensely ly RB
popular JJ
in IN
recent JJ
years s NNS
for or IN
tax NN
reasons s NNS
; :
the DT
insured ed VBN
could MD
extract VB
cash NN
value NN
in IN
the DT
form NN
of IN
policy y NN
`` ``
loans s NNS
, ,
'' ''
and CC
none NN
of IN
the DT
proceeds s NNS
were VBD
taxable able JJ
even en RB
though IN
they y PRP
included ed VBD
gains s NNS
on IN
investment ment NN
. .



Congress s NNP
closed ed VBD
this s DT
loophole NN
last JJ
year NN
, ,
or or CC
thought VBD
it PRP
did VBD
. .

However er RB
, ,
Monarch NNP
Capital al NNP
Corp. NNP
of IN
Springfield NNP
, ,
Mass. NNP
, ,
has s VBZ
developed ed VBN
a DT
`` ``
combination ion NN
plan NN
'' ''
of IN
annuity ity NN
and CC
insurance NN
coverage NN
that IN
it PRP
says s VBZ
does es VBZ
not RB
violate VB
the DT
new JJ
regulations s NNS
and CC
that DT
allows s VBZ
policy y NN
loans s NNS
without IN
tax NN
consequences es NNS
. .

But CC
the DT
percentage NN
of IN
your PRP$
cash NN
reserve NN
that IN
you PRP
can MD
borrow VB
tax-free JJ
is s VBZ
very y RB
small JJ
. .



I PRP
'm VBP
not RB
prepared ed VBN
in IN
any y DT
case NN
to TO
put VB
that DT
much JJ
money y NN
into IN
a DT
policy y NN
immediately ly RB
, ,
so IN
I PRP
look VBP
into IN
the DT
broad JJ
category y NN
called ed VBD
universal al JJ
life NN
. .

Hugely ly RB
popular JJ
, ,
it PRP
is s VBZ
far RB
more RBR
flexible ible JJ
than IN
straight JJ
whole JJ
life NN
. .

I PRP
can MD
adjust VB
the DT
amount NN
of IN
insurance NN

I PRP
want VBP
against IN
the DT
amount NN
going ing VBG
into IN
investment ment NN
; :
I PRP
can MD
pay y VB
more JJR
or or CC
less s JJR
than IN
the DT
so-called ed JJ
target NN
premium NN
in IN
a DT
given en VBN
year NN
; :
and CC
I PRP
can MD
even en RB
skip VB
payments s NNS
if IN
my y PRP$
cash NN
reserves es NNS
are VBP
enough JJ
to TO
cover er VB
the DT
insurance NN
portion ion NN
of IN
the DT
policy y NN
. .



In IN
looking ing VBG
at IN
these DT
and CC
other er JJ
policies ies NNS
, ,
I PRP
learn VBP
to TO
ask VB
pointed ed JJ
questions s NNS
about IN
some DT
of IN
the DT
assumptions s NNS
built VBN
into IN
`` ``
policy y NN
illustrations s NNS
'' ''
-- :
the DT
rows s NNS
of IN
numbers s NNS

that WDT
show VBP
me PRP

the DT
buildup NN
of IN
my y PRP$
cash NN
values es NNS
over er IN
the DT
years s NNS
. .

They y PRP
commonly ly RB
give ive VB
two CD
scenarios s NNS
: :
One CD
is s VBZ
based ed VBN
on IN
interest est NN
rates es NNS
that IN
the DT
company y NN
guarantees es VBZ
( (
usually ly RB
4 CD
% NN
to TO
4.5 CD
% NN
) )
and CC
the DT
other er JJ
on IN
the DT
rate NN

it PRP
is s VBZ
currently ly RB
getting ing VBG
on IN
investment ment NN
, ,
often en RB
8.5 CD
% NN
or or CC
more JJR
. .



Projecting ing VBG
the DT
latter er JJ
over er IN
several al JJ
decades es NNS
, ,
I PRP
find VBP
my y PRP$
cash NN
buildup NN
is s VBZ
impressive ive JJ
-- :
but CC
can MD
any y DT
high JJ
interest est NN
rate NN
prevail VB
for or IN
that DT
long RB
? .

Not RB
likely ly RB
, ,
I PRP
think VBP
. .

Also RB
, ,
some DT
policy y NN
illustrations s NNS
assume VBP
that IN
mortality ity NN
costs s NNS
will MD
decline VB
or or CC
that IN
I PRP
will MD
get VB
some DT
sort NN
of IN
dividend NN
bonus s NN
after er IN
the DT
10th JJ
year NN
. .

These DT
are VBP
not RB
certain JJ
, ,
either er RB
. .



Companies ies NNS
`` ``

n't RB
comfortable able JJ
playing ing VBG
these DT

but CC
they y PRP

'' ''
says s VBZ
Timothy y NNP

an DT

of IN

the DT

Another er DT
factor or NN
to TO

: :
Some DT
of IN
the DT

currently ly RB
earning ing VBG
very y RB
high JJ
yields s NNS
are VBP
doing ing VBG
so RB
through IN

and CC
you PRP
know VBP
how WRB

the DT

been en VBN
about IN
those DT
lately ly RB

There EX
are VBP
seemingly ly RB
endless s JJ
twists s NNS
to TO
universal al JJ
life NN
, ,
and CC
it PRP
pays s VBZ
to TO
ask VB
questions s NNS
about IN
all DT
of IN
them PRP
. .

At IN
a DT
back-yard JJ

, ,
for or IN

I PRP

Yes es RB
, ,
he PRP
says s VBZ
, ,
premiums s NNS
on IN
such JJ
variable-rate JJ

can MD
be VB
structured ed VBN
to TO
`` ``

after er IN

usually ly RB
only ly RB
if IN

high JJ
enough RB
to TO
generate VB
sufficient JJ
cash NN
to TO
cover er VB
the DT
annual al JJ
cost NN
of IN

If IN
interest est NN

plunge VBP
, ,
the DT

may y MD
be VB
knocking ing VBG

, ,
asking ing VBG

the DT

amount NN
of IN

I PRP
do VBP
n't RB
like VB
the DT
sound NN
of IN
that DT

Some DT

have VBP
also RB
started ed VBN
offering ing VBG
`` ``

'' ''
such JJ
as s IN

or or CC
a DT

higher er JJR

, ,
if IN

But CC

warns s VBZ
that IN
many y JJ
of IN

`` ``
just RB

because IN
most JJS

And CC
the DT

that IN
