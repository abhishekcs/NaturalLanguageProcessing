Another er DT

Since IN

The DT

: :

can MD

Because IN

are VBP
less s RBR

a DT

Such JJ

The DT
main JJ

: :

it PRP

any y DT

that WDT

the DT

Mr. NNP

The DT

that WDT

An DT
early ly JJ
battleground NN
was s VBD
the DT
U.S. NNP
Department ment NNP
of IN

Mr. NNP

initially ly RB
won VBD

to TO

regulated ed VBN
by y IN

Unfortunately ly RB
for or IN
Mr. NNP

another er DT

of IN

USDA NNP
, ,
the DT
Agricultural al NNP
Marketing ing NNP

was s VBD
in IN

of IN

After er IN
receiving ing VBG
complaints s NNS
from IN

, ,
this s DT
branch NN
got VBD
the DT
other er JJ

to TO

thus s RB
limiting ing VBG
the DT

's s POS

to TO

and CC
other er JJ

that WDT

The DT
egg NN
producers s NNS
also RB
lobbied ed VBD
the DT

But CC
the DT
FDA NNP
in IN
a DT
1985 CD

to TO
the DT

Egg NNP

said VBD
that IN
there EX

of IN

as s RB
long RB
as s IN

So CC
the DT

went VBD
to TO
Capitol NNP

, ,
where WRB
a DT

from IN

introduced ed VBD
a DT

to TO

Mr. NNP

whose WP$

Mr. NNP

finally ly RB

a DT

to TO

Even en RB

one CD

Foiled ed VBN
in IN
their PRP$

the DT

turned ed VBD

An DT

The DT

Mr. NNP

Now RB
