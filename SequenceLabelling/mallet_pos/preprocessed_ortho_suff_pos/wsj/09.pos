For or IN

in IN

in IN

of IN

The DT

that IN

Some DT

The DT
urging ing VBG
admittedly ly RB
has s VBZ
been en VBN
gentle JJ

In IN
an DT
interview NN
with IN
the DT
Washington NNP
Post NNP
in IN
early ly JJ
October er NNP
, ,
the DT

said VBD
the DT

may y MD
be VB
slightly ly RB
more RBR
interested ed JJ
in IN
curbing ing VBG

than IN
the DT

is s VBZ
, ,
while IN
the DT

may y MD
put VB
slightly ly RB
more JJR

on IN
spurring ing VBG

At IN
least JJS

some DT
economists s NNS
, ,
of IN
course NN
, ,
would MD
argue VB
that IN
inflation ion NN
deserves es VBZ
a DT
lot NN
of IN

Earlier er RBR
this s DT

the DT
St. NNP

Fed ed NNP
held VBD
a DT

to TO
assess s VB
the DT

's s POS

Allan NNP
Meltzer er NNP
, ,
a DT
Carnegie-Mellon NNP

noted ed VBD
that IN
the DT

The DT

argument ment NN
is s VBZ
an DT
old JJ
one CD
, ,
but CC
Mr. NNP
Brady y NNP
, ,
on IN
the DT

or or CC
off IN
, ,
is s VBZ
surely ly RB
trying ing VBG
to TO

Equally ly RB

, ,
the DT

secretary y NN
has s VBZ
spearheaded ed VBN

to TO
bring ing VB

down IN
by y IN
shopping ing VBG
avidly ly RB
for or IN
West est JJ

The DT

can MD
do VB
something ing NN
on IN
its s PRP$

but CC
to TO
have VB
any y DT
hope NN
of IN

it PRP
needs s VBZ

from IN
the DT

The DT

has s VBZ
been en VBN
helping ing VBG
, ,
but CC
apparently ly RB
not RB
especially ly RB
eagerly ly RB

The DT
Fed ed NNP
has s VBZ
been en VBN
intervening ing VBG
in IN

, ,
all RB
right JJ
, ,
but CC
through IN

, ,
at IN

, ,
it PRP
appeared ed VBD
to TO
be VB
`` ``

the DT

In IN
other er JJ
words s NNS
, ,
it PRP
was s VBD
offsetting ing VBG

of IN

and CC

by y IN
buying ing VBG

in IN
the DT

Now RB
, ,
sterilized ed VBN

may y MD
have VB
some DT

When en WRB

it PRP

a DT

for or IN

of IN
what WP

But CC
it PRP

generally ly RB
accepted ed VBN
that IN

has s VBZ
little RB
or or CC
no DT

After er IN
August NNP

the DT

may y MD
have VB
stopped ed VBN

, ,
but CC
it PRP
's s VBZ
hard JJ
to TO
see VB

on IN
the DT

The DT

is s VBZ
still RB
highly ly RB

The DT
Fed ed NNP
has s VBZ
let VBN

slip VBP
slightly ly RB
, ,
but CC
whether er IN
the DT

Legal al JJ

have VBP
a DT

of IN
assuming ing VBG

far RB
exceeding ing VBG
what WP

They y PRP
speak VBP
volumes es NNS
about IN
the DT
state NN
of IN
our PRP$
society y NN
at IN
a DT
given en VBN
moment ment NN

It PRP
has s VBZ
always s RB
been en VBN
so RB
. .

In IN
the DT
1920s s CD
, ,
a DT
young JJ
schoolteacher er NN
, ,
John NNP
T. NNP
Scopes es NNP
, ,
volunteered ed VBD

be VB
a DT

in IN

challenge VB
a DT
ban NN
on IN
the DT
teaching ing NN
of IN

imposed ed VBN
by y IN
the DT
Tennessee NNP

The DT
result NN
was s VBD
a DT
world-famous ous JJ
trial al NN
exposing ing VBG

in IN

between en IN

whose WP$

and CC
the DT
religious ous JJ
fundamentalists s NNS
, ,
whom WP
Mencken en NNP
derided ed VBD
as s IN
benighted ed JJ
primitives es NNS
. .

Few JJ
now RB
recall VBP
the DT
actual al JJ
outcome NN
: :

was s VBD
convicted ed VBN
and CC
fined ed VBN
$ $
100 CD
, ,
and CC
his s PRP$

was s VBD
reversed ed VBN
on IN
appeal al NN
because IN
the DT

was s VBD
excessive ive JJ
under er IN
Tennessee NNP

So IN
it PRP
was s VBD
with IN
the DT
Hiss s NNP

a DT

later er RB
, ,
when en WRB
Alger er NNP
Hiss s NNP

to TO
the DT
rather er RB
banal al JJ

he PRP
allegedly ly RB
had VBD

And CC
so IN
it PRP
seems s VBZ
to TO
be VB
with IN
the DT
case NN
of IN
Elizabeth NNP
Morgan NNP
, ,
the DT
Washington NNP
, ,
D.C. NNP
, ,

a DT

case NN
for or IN
refusing ing VBG
to TO

the DT

of IN
her er PRP$

Dr. NNP
Morgan NNP
has s VBZ
just RB
emerged ed VBN
from IN
the DT

after er IN
more JJR
than IN
two CD

' POS
confinement ment NN
for or IN
contempt NN
of IN

, ,
a DT
heroine NN
to TO
her er PRP$
many y JJ
supporters s NNS
. .



To TO
the DT
rest est NN
of IN
us s PRP
, ,
the DT
case NN
is s VBZ
a DT
puzzle NN
. .

It PRP
is s VBZ
what WP
lawyers s NNS
call VBP
`` ``
fact NN
intensive ive JJ
. .

'' ''
It PRP
presents s VBZ
no DT
great JJ
issue NN
of IN
legal al JJ
principle NN
, ,
no DT
overriding ing VBG
question ion NN
of IN
family ly NN
law NN
or or CC
the DT
law NN
of IN
contempt NN
. .

Instead RB
, ,
it PRP
turns s VBZ
on IN
the DT
disputed ed VBN
and CC
elusive ive JJ
facts s NNS
of IN
`` ``
who WP
did VBD
what WP

whom WP
. .

'' ''
It PRP
is s VBZ
difficult JJ
, ,
if IN
not RB
impossible ible JJ
, ,
for or IN
anyone NN

who WP
has s VBZ
not RB
pored ed VBN
over er IN
the DT
thousands s NNS
of IN
pages es NNS
of IN
court NN
pleadings s NNS
and CC
transcripts s NNS
to TO
have VB
a DT
worthwhile JJ
opinion ion NN
on IN
the DT
underlying ing VBG
merits s NNS
of IN
the DT
controversy y NN
. .

Certainly ly RB
I PRP
do VBP
not RB
. .



So IN
we PRP
must MD
look VB
elsewhere RB
for or IN
an DT
explanation ion NN
of IN
the DT
unusual al JJ
power er NN

this s DT
case NN
has s VBZ
exerted ed VBN
over er IN
the DT
minds s NNS
of IN
many y JJ
, ,
not RB
just RB
in IN
Washington NNP
but CC
elsewhere RB
in IN
the DT
country y NN
and CC
even en RB
the DT
world NN
. .

I PRP
suggest est VBP
that IN
three CD
themes es NNS
have VBP
come VBN
together er RB
in IN
the DT
strange JJ
case NN
of IN
Dr. NNP
Morgan NNP
. .



The DT
first JJ
is s VBZ
that IN
it PRP
represents s VBZ
an DT
intense JJ
battle NN
in IN
what WP

James es NNP
Thurber er NNP
used ed VBD
to TO
caricature VB
as s IN
`` ``
the DT
war NN
between en IN
the DT
sexes es NNS
. .

'' ''
But CC
although IN
Thurber er NNP
did VBD
so RB
gently ly RB
and CC
lightheartedly ly RB
, ,
many y JJ
of IN
Dr. NNP
Morgan NNP
's s POS
supporters s NNS
have VBP
taken en VBN
Thurber er NNP
's s POS
memorable able JJ
title NN
`` ``
The NNP
Male NNP
Animal al NNP
'' ''
quite RB
literally ly RB
. .

The DT
vehemence NN
of IN
the DT
emotions s NNS
aroused ed VBN
by y IN
the DT
case NN
testifies ies VBZ
to TO
its s PRP$
symbolic ic JJ
importance NN
in IN
the DT
war NN
that IN
Thurber er NNP
accepted ed VBD
as s IN
an DT
eternal al JJ
part NN
of IN
the DT
human JJ
condition ion NN
. .



A DT
second JJ
theme NN
is s VBZ
the DT
undercurrent NN
of IN
social al JJ
class s NN
and CC
race NN
in IN
the DT
public ic JJ
reaction ion NN
to TO
the DT
Morgan NNP
case NN
. .

Dr. NNP
Morgan NNP
is s VBZ
a DT
highly ly RB
educated ed VBN
white JJ
professional al NN

who WP
attended ed VBD
some DT
of IN
the DT
`` ``
best est JJS
'' ''
schools s NNS
. .

As s IN
members s NNS
of IN
the DT
Black NNP
Caucus s NNP
in IN
Congress s NNP
asked ed VBD
during ing IN
the DT
debate NN
on IN
the DT
legislation ion NN

that WDT
freed ed VBD
Dr. NNP
Morgan NNP
, ,
does es VBZ
anyone NN
seriously ly RB
believe VB
that IN
if IN
she PRP
were VBD
an DT
uneducated ed JJ
, ,
black JJ
, ,
working-class s JJ
woman NN
, ,
Congress s NNP
would MD
have VB
rushed ed VBN
to TO
pass s VB
a DT
private JJ
relief NN
bill NN
freeing ing VBG
her er PRP
? .

Or CC
that IN
the DT
president NN
would MD
have VB
hurried ed VBN
to TO
sign VB
the DT
bill NN
`` ``
out IN
of IN
compassion ion NN
for or IN
her er PRP$
plight NN
'' ''
? .

To TO
ask VB
those DT
questions s NNS
is s VBZ
to TO
answer er VB
them PRP
. .



Finally ly RB
, ,
the DT
case NN
of IN
Dr. NNP
Morgan NNP
gave VBD
Congress s NNP

an DT
opportunity ity NN
to TO
act VB
with IN
unaccustomed ed JJ
decisiveness ness NN
and CC
to TO
engage VB
in IN
one CD
of IN
its s PRP$
favorite JJ
pastimes es NNS
-- :
bashing ing VBG

the DT
District NNP
of IN
Columbia NNP
government ment NN
. .

The DT
local al JJ
government ment NN
is s VBZ
discredited ed VBN
in IN
the DT
eyes es NNS
of IN
many y JJ
residents s NNS
for or IN
a DT
variety y NN
of IN
reasons s NNS
, ,
and CC
congressmen en NNS
read VBP
the DT
same JJ
newspapers s NNS
and CC
watch VBP
the DT
same JJ
TV NN
newscasts s NNS
as s IN
other er JJ
people NNS
in IN
the DT
area NN
do VBP
. .

Bashing ing VBG

the DT
D.C. NNP
government ment NN
is s VBZ
risk-free JJ
for or IN
members s NNS
of IN
Congress s NNP
, ,
who WP
do VBP
not RB
have VB
to TO
answer er VB
to TO
their PRP$
own JJ
constituents s NNS
for or IN
it PRP
. .



Congress s NNP
is s VBZ
paralyzed ed VBN
from IN
acting ing VBG
on IN
such JJ
great JJ
issues es NNS
of IN
the DT
day y NN
as s IN
the DT
federal al JJ
budget NN
deficit NN
. .

Yet RB
a DT
bill NN
tailored ed VBN
to TO
the DT
interests s NNS
of IN
a DT
single JJ
individual al NN
passed ed VBD
Congress s NNP
with IN
almost RB
unimaginable able JJ
speed ed NN
, ,
before IN
the DT
judicial al JJ
process s NN
had VBD
run VBN
its s PRP$
course NN
, ,
and CC
, ,
indeed ed RB
, ,
while IN
the DT
Morgan NNP
case NN
was s VBD
awaiting ing VBG
a DT
ruling ing NN
by y IN
the DT
appellate JJ
court NN
. .



The DT
Morgan NNP
case NN
thus s RB
tells s VBZ
us s PRP
much RB
more RBR
about IN
the DT
current JJ
state NN
of IN
sex NN
, ,

and CC

than IN
it PRP
does es VBZ
about IN
the DT
facts s NNS
of IN
Dr. NNP
Morgan NNP
's s POS
particular JJ

. .

It PRP
may y MD
stand VB
as s IN
a DT

for or IN
how WRB

and CC

the DT

in IN
that DT
