seriously ly RB
suggesting ing VBG
that IN

Apparently ly RB
so RB

There EX

but CC
we PRP

that IN

that WDT

in IN

Now RB
that IN

appears s VBZ
to TO

pulled ed VBN
out IN

, ,
the DT

is s VBZ
talking ing VBG

about IN

an DT
`` ``

coalition ion NN
government ment NN
in IN
the DT
Cambodian JJ
capital al NN
of IN
Phnom NNP

The DT

would MD
include VB
the DT

by y IN

The DT

of IN

by y IN
allowing ing VBG

a DT

The DT

says s VBZ
that IN
any y DT

would MD
have VB
to TO
be VB
`` ``

'' ''


The DT
usual al JJ
problem NN
with IN
including ing VBG

in IN
`` ``

is s VBZ
that IN
their PRP$

require VBP
they y PRP
squeeze VBP
out IN
everyone NN
else RB

Recall VB
that IN
Nicaragua NNP

came VBD
into IN
Managua NNP
as s IN

in IN
a DT

Within IN

the DT

In IN

when en WRB

bowed ed VBD

such PDT
a DT

it PRP

Even en RB

What WP
complicates es VBZ
the DT
scene NN
in IN

is s VBZ
that IN
the DT
current JJ

is s VBZ
already y RB
communist JJ
, ,
as s IN

its s PRP$
Vietnamese JJ

the DT

-- :
who WP

the DT

of IN
the DT

It PRP
's s VBZ
not RB
clear JJ
which WDT

of IN

might MD
prevail VB
in IN
a DT

, ,
but CC
the DT
one CD
good JJ
bet NN
is s VBZ
that IN
the DT
non-communists s NNS
would MD
disappear VB
. .

That DT
would MD
leave VB
Hun NNP
Sen en NNP
and CC
the DT
Khmer er NNP
Rouge NNP
. .



The DT
Hun NNP
Sen en NNP
regime NN
has s VBZ
sent VBN
thousands s NNS
of IN
conscript JJ

to TO
die VB
of IN
malaria NN
and CC
malnourishment ment NN
while IN
building ing VBG
Cambodia NNP
's s POS
equivalent NN
of IN
the DT
Berlin NNP

The DT
Khmer er NNP

, ,
however er RB
, ,
carry y VBP
an DT
unsurpassed ed JJ
record NN
for or IN
Cambodian JJ
tyranny y NN
. .

These DT
utopians s NNS
caused ed VBD
the DT
deaths s NNS
-- :
by y IN
starvation ion NN
, ,
disease NN
or or CC
execution ion NN
-- :
of IN
well RB
over er IN
one CD
million ion CD
Cambodians s NNPS
. .

The DT
Cambodian JJ
horror or NN
was s VBD
so RB
bad JJ
that IN
the DT
Vietnamese JJ
occupation ion NN
in IN
1978 CD
was s VBD
a DT
perverse JJ
form NN
of IN
relief NN
. .



The DT
world NN
might MD
want VB
to TO
believe VB
that IN
the DT
Khmer er NNP
Rouge NNP
ca MD
n't RB
still RB
be VB
such JJ
bad JJ
guys s NNS
, ,
just RB
as s IN
in IN
the DT
late JJ
1970s s CD
it PRP
was s VBD
reluctant JJ
to TO
credit VB
the DT
reports s NNS
of IN

then en RB
taking ing VBG

. .

But CC
there EX
is s VBZ
no DT
solid JJ
evidence NN
that IN
the DT
Khmer er NNP

have VBP
changed ed VBN

Some DT
of IN
our PRP$

say y VBP
the DT

up IN
this s DT
summer er NN
in IN
Khmer er NNP
Rouge NNP

near IN
the DT
Thai-Cambodian JJ
border er NN

So IN
it PRP
's s VBZ
difficult JJ
to TO
swallow VB
the DT
notion ion NN
that IN
Mr. NNP

is s VBZ
willing ing JJ
to TO

that WDT

help VB

set VBD

of IN
such PDT
a DT

at IN

But CC

over er IN
the DT

, ,
and CC

rather er RB
better er RB

Nor or CC

worry y VB
much RB
about IN

which WDT

It PRP

that IN

The DT

the DT

of IN

for or IN
two CD
reasons s NNS

First JJ
, ,
its s PRP$
position ion NN
in IN
the DT

is s VBZ
anomalous ous JJ
. .

It PRP
has s VBZ
an DT
unusual al JJ
kind NN
of IN
independence NN
from IN
elected ed VBN
officials s NNS
and CC
still RB
has s VBZ
authority ity NN
over er IN
one CD
of IN
the DT
most RBS
powerful ful JJ
of IN

's s POS
instruments s NNS
-- :
the DT
control NN
of IN
the DT

. .

Thus s RB
we PRP
have VBP
a DT
condition ion NN

that WDT
is s VBZ
easily ly RB
described ed VBN
as s IN
undemocratic ic JJ
. .

Second JJ
, ,
the DT
responsibilities ies NNS
of IN
the DT
Federal al NNP
Reserve NNP
as s IN
guardian NN
of IN
the DT
currency y NN
, ,
which WDT
means s VBZ
as s IN
guardian NN
of IN
the DT
stability ity NN
of IN
the DT
price NN
level NN
, ,
sometimes es RB
lead VBP
it PRP
to TO
take VB
measures es NNS

that WDT
are VBP
unpopular JJ
. .

As s IN
former er JJ
Fed ed NNP
Chairman NNP
William NNP
McChesney y NNP
Martin NNP
used ed VBD
to TO
say y VB
, ,
they y PRP
would MD
have VB
to TO
take VB
the DT
punch NN
bowl NN
away y RB
just RB
as s IN
the DT
party y NN
is s VBZ
getting ing VBG
interesting ing JJ
. .



So IN
the DT
Federal al NNP
Reserve NNP
is s VBZ
an DT
attractive ive JJ
target NN
for or IN
complaint NN
by y IN
politicians s NNS
. .

The DT
Fed ed NNP
is s VBZ
easily ly RB
assigned ed VBN
the DT
blame NN
for or IN
unpleasantness ness NN
, ,
like IN
high JJ
interest est NN
rates es NNS
or or CC
slow JJ
economic ic JJ
growth NN
, ,
while IN
the DT
politicians s NNS
can MD
escape VB
responsibility ity NN
by y IN
pointing ing VBG
to TO
the DT
Fed ed NNP
's s POS
independence NN
. .



This s DT
leads s VBZ
to TO
proposals s NNS
for or IN
`` ``

'' ''
of IN
the DT
Fed ed NNP
, ,
which WDT
have VBP
the DT
common JJ
feature NN
of IN
making ing VBG
the DT
Fed ed NNP
more RBR
responsive ive JJ
to TO
the DT

, ,
to TO
the DT
Congress s NNP
and CC
to TO
public ic JJ
opinion ion NN
-- :
without IN
, ,
however er RB
, ,
any y DT
assumption ion NN
of IN
additional al JJ
responsibility ity NN
by y IN
the DT
politicians s NNS
. .

These DT
proposals s NNS
include VBP
changing ing VBG
the DT
term NN
of IN
the DT
chairman NN
, ,
shortening ing VBG
the DT
terms s NNS
of IN
the DT
members s NNS
, ,
eliminating ing VBG
the DT
presidents s NNS
of IN
the DT
Federal al NNP
Reserve NNP
Banks s NNPS
from IN
the DT
decision-making ing JJ
process s NN
, ,
putting ing VBG
the DT
Secretary y NNP
of IN
the DT

on IN
the DT
Federal al NNP
Reserve NNP

, ,
having ing VBG
the DT

audited ed VBD
by y IN
an DT
arm NN
of IN
Congress s NNP
( (
the DT

, ,
putting ing VBG
the DT

in IN
the DT

, ,
and CC
requiring ing VBG

publication ion NN
of IN
the DT

's s POS

Some DT
of IN
these DT
ideas s NNS
are VBP
again RB
under er IN
consideration ion NN
in IN
Congress s NNP

But CC
these DT
proposals s NNS
do VBP
not RB
rest est VB
on IN
a DT

of IN
what WP

the DT

's s POS

is s VBZ
or or CC

if IN
they y PRP

they y PRP

They y PRP
would MD
not RB
solve VB
the DT

; :
they y PRP
would MD
make VB

The DT
problem NN
is s VBZ
not RB
that IN

too RB
unresponsive ive JJ
to TO

On IN

, ,
it PRP

too RB

The DT

in IN

U.S. NNP
is s VBZ
now RB
about IN
4 CD

On IN

In IN

a DT

-- :
the DT

The DT
enormous ous JJ
inflation ion NN
over er IN
the DT
past JJ
30 CD
years s NNS
was s VBD
largely ly RB
due JJ
to TO
monetary y JJ

At IN

, ,
it PRP
would MD
not RB
have VB
happened ed VBN

the DT

of IN

that WDT

would MD
not RB
have VB
happened ed VBN
without IN

of IN

The DT
basic ic JJ
problem NN
of IN

, ,
to TO
which WDT

of IN

should MD
be VB
addressed ed VBN

is s VBZ
to TO
prevent VB
a DT

of IN
this s DT

There EX
were VBD
two CD

reasons s NNS
for or IN
the DT
mistaken en JJ

of IN
the DT
past JJ
30 CD

: :


1 CD
. .

To TO
some DT
extent NN

the DT
Federal al NNP

shared ed VBD
the DT

that IN

could MD
yield VB
a DT

2 CD

Even en RB
where WRB

did VBD
not RB
share VB
this s DT
view NN

it PRP
felt VBD
the DT

to TO
accommodate VB

Despite IN
all PDT
the DT
formal al JJ
provisions s NNS
for or IN
its s PRP$

the DT

seems s VBZ
constantly ly RB
to TO
feel VB
that IN
if IN
it PRP

its s PRP$

too RB
freely ly RB
it PRP
will MD

The DT
common JJ
proposals s NNS
for or IN

would MD
only ly RB
make VB
the DT

worse JJR
, ,
if IN

Putting ing VBG

one CD
of IN

is s VBZ
an DT

The DT

These DT

from IN

How WRB

Could MD

The DT

perfectly ly RB
clear JJ

( (
True JJ

a DT

the DT

in IN

that IN

The DT

's s POS

is s VBZ
not RB
that IN

are VBP
correct JJ
to TO

that IN

What WP
is s VBZ

is s VBZ
the DT

of IN
