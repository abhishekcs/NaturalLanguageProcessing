, ,
says s VBZ
the DT
new JJ

by y IN

since IN

may y MD
result VB
in IN
a DT

in IN

, ,
though IN
that DT

n't RB
happened ed VBN
so RB
far RB
. .



In IN
addition ion NN
to TO
resuscitating ing VBG
the DT
old JJ
issue NN
of IN
whether er IN
death NN

deter er VBP
criminals s NNS
, ,
this s DT
bill NN
has s VBZ
made VBN
race NN

a DT
major or JJ
part NN
of IN
the DT

debate NN
. .

Before IN
the DT

left VBD
committee NN
, ,
Sen. NNP
Edward NNP
Kennedy y NNP
( (
D. NNP
, ,
Mass s NNP

) )
attached ed VBD
an DT
amendment ment NN

that WDT
would MD
allow VB
a DT
defendant NN
to TO
escape VB
from IN
a DT

sentence NN
in IN
jurisdictions s NNS
shown VBN
to TO
have VB
meted ed VBN
out RP
executions s NNS
in IN
a DT
racist NN
manner er NN

The DT
amendment ment NN
prompted ed VBD
an DT
ironic ic JJ
protest est NN
from IN
Mr. NNP
Thurmond NNP
, ,
who WP
complained ed VBD
that IN
it PRP
would MD
`` ``
kill VB
'' ''
capital al JJ
punishment ment NN
. .

A DT
large JJ
number er NN
of IN
studies ies NNS
suggest est VBP
that IN
state NN
judges es NNS
and CC
juries ies NNS
have VBP
imposed ed VBN
the DT
penalty y NN
in IN
a DT
racially ly RB
discriminatory y JJ
fashion ion NN
. .

And CC
the DT
Kennedy y NNP
amendment ment NN
would MD
invade VB
not RB
only ly RB
federal al JJ
but CC
state NN
sentencings s NNS
, ,
in IN
two CD
important JJ
ways s NNS
. .

It PRP
would MD
allow VB
all DT
defendants s NNS
to TO
introduce VB
statistical al JJ
evidence NN
showing ing VBG
racially ly RB
disproportionate JJ
application ion NN
of IN
the DT
death NN
penalty y NN
in IN
the DT

. .

And CC
it PRP
would MD
shift VB
the DT
burden en NN
to TO
prosecutors s NNS
to TO
disprove VB
that IN
discrimination ion NN
caused ed VBD
any y DT
statistical al JJ
racial al JJ

`` ``
That DT

is s VBZ
very y RB
difficult JJ
, ,
if IN

impossible ible JJ

to TO

'' ''
says s VBZ
Mr. NNP

`` ``
How WRB

'' ''
Since IN
most JJS

would MD
n't RB
be VB
able able JJ
to TO
demonstrate VB
conclusively ly RB
that IN

did VBD

everywhere RB
might MD
come VB
to TO
a DT

, ,
Mr. NNP
Boyd NNP
explains s VBZ
. .



At IN
least JJS
15 CD
major or JJ
studies ies NNS
purport VBP
to TO
show VB
that IN

have VBP
imposed ed VBN
the DT
death NN

disproportionately ly RB
against IN
killers s NNS
of IN
whites es NNS
compared ed VBN
with IN

, ,
and CC
against IN
black JJ
defendants s NNS
compared ed VBN
with IN
white JJ
defendants s NNS
. .

Conservatives es NNS
question ion VBP
the DT
validity ity NN
of IN
the DT
studies ies NNS
and CC
note VBP
that IN
the DT
Supreme NNP

ruled ed VBD
in IN

that IN

, ,
regardless s RB
of IN

, ,
is s VBZ
n't RB
relevant JJ
to TO
a DT
constitutional al JJ
attack NN
on IN
a DT

The DT
Kennedy y NNP
amendment ment NN
would MD
, ,
in IN

legislate VB
around IN

Lawyers s NNS

But CC
if IN

it PRP
could MD
prompt VB

according ing VBG
to TO
the DT
Mr. NNP
Burr NNP

It PRP
might MD
force VB
Congress s NNP

the DT

to TO

The DT
story y NN
of IN

goes es VBZ
back RB
to TO
the DT
1970s s NNS
, ,
when en WRB
a DT
pediatrician NN
named ed VBN
Alfred ed NNP
G. NNP
Knudson NNP

proposed ed VBD
that DT

stemmed ed VBD
from IN
two CD

genetic ic JJ

He PRP
theorized ed VBD
that IN
in IN

an DT

from IN

The DT

he PRP

developed ed VBD
when en WRB
the DT

Back RB
then en RB

no DT

they y PRP

Occasionally ly RB

he PRP

His s PRP$
