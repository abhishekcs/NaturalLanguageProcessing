simply ly RB
moving ing VBG

a DT

in IN

U.S NNP

Moreover er RB
, ,
there EX
are VBP
questions s NNS

particularly ly RB
among IN
atmospheric ic JJ
scientists s NNS

who WP
know VBP
this s DT
subject NN
best est RB
, ,
about IN
the DT
ability ity NN
of IN
anyone NN
to TO
know VB
what WP
in IN
fact NN
is s VBZ
happening ing VBG
to TO
the DT
ozone NN
layer er NN

It PRP
is s VBZ
generally ly RB
agreed ed VBN
that IN
when en WRB
CFCs s NNP
rise NN
from IN
earth NN
to TO
stratosphere NN
, ,
the DT
chlorine NN
in IN
them PRP
is s VBZ
capable able JJ
of IN
interfering ing VBG
with IN
the DT
process s NN
through IN
which WDT
ultraviolet NN
rays s NNS
split VBD
oxygen en NN
molecules es NNS
and CC
form NN
ozone NN

But CC
ozone NN
creation ion NN
is s VBZ
a DT
very y RB
large-scale JJ
natural al JJ
process s NN
and CC
the DT
importance NN
of IN
human-generated ed JJ
CFCs s NNP
in IN
reducing ing VBG
it PRP
is s VBZ
largely ly RB
a DT
matter er NN
of IN
conjecture NN
. .

The DT
ozone NN
layer er NN
is s VBZ
constantly ly RB
in IN
motion ion NN
and CC
thus s RB
very y RB
hard JJ
to TO
measure VB
. .

What WP
scientists s NNS
have VBP
known VBN
since IN
the DT
late JJ
1970s s CD
is s VBZ
that IN
there EX
is s VBZ
a DT

in IN
the DT
layer er NN
over er IN
Antarctica NNP

that WDT
expands s VBZ
or or CC

from IN

to TO

But CC
it PRP
is s VBZ
at IN
least JJS
worthy y JJ
of IN
some DT
note NN
that IN
there EX
are VBP
very y RB
few JJ
refrigerators s NNS
in IN
Antarctica NNP

Moreover er RB
, ,
surely ly RB
someone NN
has s VBZ
noticed ed VBN
that IN

refrigerators s NNS
are VBP
closed ed VBN

, ,
running ing VBG
for or IN
many y JJ

without IN
either er CC

or or CC
the DT

ever er RB
escaping ing VBG

Another er DT
argument ment NN
of IN
the DT
environmentalists s NNS
is s VBZ
that IN
if IN
substitutes es NNS
are VBP
available able JJ
, ,
why y WRB
not RB
use VB
them PRP
? .

Mr. NNP
Teagan NNP
cites es VBZ
a DT

of IN

none NN
, ,
so RB
far RB
, ,
match VBP

Butane NN

propane NN
can MD
be VB
used ed VBN
as s IN
coolants s NNS
, ,
for or IN

, ,
but CC
are VBP
flammable able JJ

Moreover er RB
, ,
new JJ
lubricants s NNS
will MD
be VB
needed ed VBN
to TO
protect VB
compressors s NNS
from IN
the DT
new JJ
formulations s NNS
, ,
which WDT
, ,
as s IN
with IN
CFCs s NNP
, ,
are VBP
solvents s NNS

Mr. NNP
Teagan NNP
points s VBZ
out IN
as s RB
well RB
that IN
if IN
the DT
equipment ment NN
designed ed VBN
to TO
get VB
along IN
without IN
CFCs s NNP
is s VBZ
less s RBR
efficient JJ
than IN
current JJ

, ,
energy y NN

will MD
rise VB
and CC
that WDT

worsen en VB
the DT

who WP

where WRB

but CC

This s DT

The DT

The DT

Even en RB

Finally ly RB

the DT
