In IN

the DT

is s VBZ
one CD
of IN
the DT
last JJ

A DT

creeping ing VBG

it PRP
has s VBZ
become VBN
a DT
subject NN
of IN
sharp JJ
controversy y NN
on IN
the DT

The DT
Court NNP
of IN
Appeals s NNPS
for or IN

was s VBD
created ed VBN
in IN
1982 CD
to TO

as s IN
the DT
court NN
of IN

for or IN

Previously ly RB

to TO
one CD

There RB

grappled ed VBD
with IN
some DT

the DT
most RBS

complex JJ

imaginable able JJ
. .



A DT
new JJ

was s VBD
sought VBN
by y IN
patent NN

who WP
believed ed VBD
that IN
the DT

had VBD
botched ed VBN
too RB
many y RB
important JJ
, ,
multimillion-dollar JJ
cases es NNS

Some DT

that IN
such PDT
a DT

would MD
be VB
filled ed VBN
with IN

in IN

Since IN

These DT
mega-issues es NNS
are VBP
being ing VBG
propelled ed VBN
by y IN
two CD
factors s NNS
, ,
economic ic JJ
and CC
political al JJ

In IN

As s IN
a DT

, ,
industry y NN
operated ed VBD
out IN
of IN
small JJ
, ,
expensive ive JJ
, ,
highly ly RB
inefficient JJ
industrial al JJ
units s NNS

When en WRB
Mr. NNP

came VBD
to TO

, ,
he PRP
ushered ed VBD
in RP
new JJ
rules es NNS
for or IN

He PRP

If IN
the DT

too RB
great JJ
for or IN
the DT
domestic ic JJ
market NN
, ,
he PRP
said VBD
, ,
companies ies NNS

India NNP

overregulated ed JJ
businessmen en NNS
had VBD
to TO
be VB
persuaded ed VBN
, ,
but CC
they y PRP
have VBP
started ed VBD
to TO

. .

Some DT
of IN
the DT
projects s NNS
being ing VBG
funded ed JJ
by y IN
the DT
new JJ

are VBP
the DT
first JJ
fruits s NNS
of IN
Mr. NNP
Gandhi NNP
's s POS

, ,
and CC
they y PRP
require VBP
more JJR
capital al JJ
than IN
the DT
smaller er JJR
industrial al JJ
units s NNS
built VBN
in IN
the DT
past NN
. .

The DT
industrial al JJ
revolution ion NN
has s VBZ
produced ed VBN
an DT
explosion ion NN
in IN
the DT
capital al NN
market NN
, ,
which WDT
is s VBZ
a DT
far RB
cheaper er JJR
source NN
of IN

than IN
government-controlled ed JJ
banks s NNS
, ,
where WRB

for or IN
prime JJ

are VBP
around RB
16 CD
% NN
. .



The DT
second JJ
factor or NN
spurring ing VBG

is s VBZ
political al JJ
. .

Mr. NNP
Gandhi NNP
has s VBZ
called ed VBN
general al JJ
elections s NNS
for or IN
November er NNP
, ,
and CC
many y JJ
businessmen en NNS
fear VBP
that IN
he PRP
and CC
his s PRP$
Congress s NNP
( (
I NNP
) )
Party y NNP
will MD

. .

Some DT
companies ies NNS
are VBP
raising ing VBG
money y NN
in IN
anticipation ion NN
of IN
a DT
government ment NN
less s RBR
predictable able JJ
than IN
Mr. NNP
Gandhi NNP
's s POS
, ,
and CC
possibly ly RB
more RBR
restrictive ive JJ
. .



The DT
buoyant JJ
Bombay y NNP
rumor or NN
mill NN
also RB
says s VBZ
that IN
some DT
of IN
the DT

raised ed VBN
in IN
the DT
current JJ
spate NN
of IN

will MD
be VB
used ed VBN
as s IN
campaign NN
donations s NNS
before IN
the DT

. .

No DT
one NN
admits s VBZ
to TO
anything ing NN
, ,
but CC
India NNP
's s POS
industrialists s NNS
have VBP
a DT
history y NN
of IN
making ing VBG
under-the-table able JJ
campaign NN
donations s NNS
. .



So RB
far RB
, ,
the DT
mega-issues es NNS
are VBP
a DT

with IN

Some DT
