In IN

to TO

the DT

that IN

In IN

in IN

the DT
`` ``

and CC
this s DT

If IN

at IN

between en IN

the DT

, ,
less s CC
any y DT

from IN

The DT
worst-case JJ
scenario NN

if IN

If IN

Once IN

The DT

establishes es VBZ
a DT
minimum NN

When en WRB
a DT

below IN
the DT

's s POS

, ,
the DT

simply ly RB

the DT

at IN

and CC
simultaneously ly RB

the DT

at IN
a DT

Or CC

The DT
accompanying ing JJ

shows s VBZ
how WRB
this s DT

would MD
work VB
for or IN
three CD

Though IN
not RB

in IN

, ,
an DT

should MD
know VB
that IN

can MD
be VB
partially ly RB
offset VBN
by y IN
any y DT
dividends s NNS
that WDT
the DT

pays s VBZ

For or IN
example NN
, ,
Tenneco NNP
Inc. NNP
pays s VBZ
a DT
quarterly ly JJ
dividend NN
of IN
76 CD
cents s NNS
, ,
which WDT
would MD
be VB
received ed VBN
before IN
the DT
February y NNP

expires es VBZ
and CC
, ,
thus s RB
, ,
reduce VB
the DT
cost NN
of IN
using ing VBG
the DT
technique NN
by y IN
that DT
amount NN
. .

In IN
this s DT
case NN
, ,
the DT
investor or NN
's s POS
risk NN
would MD
n't RB
exceed ed VB
3.6 CD
% NN
of IN
the DT
total al JJ

To TO
simplify y VB
the DT
calculations s NNS
, ,
commissions s NNS
on IN
the DT

and CC
underlying ing JJ

are VBP
n't RB
included ed VBN
in IN

There EX
are VBP
more JJR
than IN
650 CD

on IN
which WDT
options s NNS
may y MD
be VB
bought VBN
and CC

, ,
including ing VBG
some DT
over-the-counter er JJ
stocks s NNS

But CC
some DT
investors s NNS
might MD
prefer er VB
a DT
simpler er JJR
strategy y NN
then en RB
hedging ing VBG
their PRP$
individual al JJ
holdings s NNS
. .



They y PRP
can MD
do VB
this s DT
by y IN
purchasing ing VBG
`` ``
index NN

, ,
'' ''
which WDT
are VBP
simply ly RB
put VBN
options s NNS
on IN
indexes es NNS

that WDT
match VBP
broad JJ
baskets s NNS
of IN
stocks s NNS
. .

For or IN
instance NN
, ,
the DT
most RBS
popular JJ
index NN
option ion NN
is s VBZ
the DT
S&P NNP
100 CD
option ion NN
, ,
commonly ly RB
called ed VBN
the DT
OEX NNP
. .

It PRP
is s VBZ
based ed VBN
on IN
the DT
stocks s NNS

that WDT
make VBP
up RP
Standard NNP
& CC
Poor or NNP
's s POS
100-stock CD
index NN
. .

Unlike IN
options s NNS
on IN
individual al JJ
issues es NNS
, ,
index NN
options s NNS
are VBP
settled ed VBN
only ly RB
in IN
cash NN
, ,
and CC
no DT

is s VBZ
ever er RB

But CC
while IN

options s NNS
are VBP
convenient JJ
, ,
they y PRP
have VBP
several al JJ
disadvantages es NNS
. .

For or IN
one CD
thing ing NN
, ,
an DT
investor or NN
's s POS
portfolio NN
might MD
not RB
closely ly RB
match VB
the DT
S&P NNP
100 CD
. .

As s IN
a DT
result NN
, ,
the DT
OEX NNP
insurance NN
may y MD
or or CC
may y MD
not RB
fully ly RB
protect VB
an DT
investor or NN
's s POS
holdings s NNS
in IN
the DT
event NN
of IN
a DT

decline NN
. .



In IN
addition ion NN
, ,
OEX NNP
options s NNS
were VBD
suspended ed VBN
from IN

last JJ
Friday y NNP

, ,
after er IN
the DT

under er IN
way y NN
and CC
trading ing NN
in IN
the DT
S&P-500 NNP

was s VBD
halted ed VBN

So IN
an DT

who WP
wanted ed VBD
to TO
realize VB
a DT

on IN

after er IN
the DT

On IN

only ly RB
a DT
handful ful NN
of IN

were VBD
suspended ed VBN

Normally ly RB
, ,
once RB
the DT

from IN

, ,
the DT
options s NNS
on IN
those DT

also RB
do VBP
n't RB
trade VB
. .



Ultimately ly RB
, ,
whether er IN
the DT
insurance NN
provided ed VBN
by y IN
purchasing ing VBG
puts s NNS
is s VBZ
worthwhile JJ
depends s VBZ
on IN
the DT
cost NN
of IN
the DT

. .

That DT
cost NN
rises es VBZ
in IN

of IN

But CC
it PRP
still RB
might MD
be VB
cheaper er JJR
than IN
taking ing VBG
a DT
major or JJ

. .



The DT
protection ion NN
from IN
using ing VBG
married ed JJ

is s VBZ
clearly ly RB
superior or JJ
to TO
that DT
afforded ed VBN
by y IN

some DT

consider er VBP
using ing VBG
during ing IN
troubled ed JJ
times es NNS
: :
selling ing VBG
call NN
options s NNS
on IN

the DT
investor or NN
owns s VBZ
. .

A DT

option ion NN
is s VBZ
similar JJ
to TO
a DT

, ,
except IN
that IN
it PRP
gives es VBZ
its s PRP$
owner er NN

the DT
right NN
to TO
buy y VB
shares es NNS
at IN
a DT
stated ed JJ
price NN
until IN

. .



Selling ing VBG
a DT
call NN

gives es VBZ
an DT
investor or NN

a DT
small JJ
buffer er NN
against IN
a DT
stock-market NN
decline NN
. .

That DT
's s VBZ
because IN
it PRP
reduces es VBZ
the DT
cost NN
of IN
the DT
stock NN
by y IN
the DT
amount NN
of IN
premium NN
received ed VBN
from IN
the DT

of IN
the DT

But CC
if IN
the DT
price NN
of IN
the DT

above IN
the DT

of IN

, ,
the DT

And CC
in IN
