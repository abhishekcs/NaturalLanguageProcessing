To TO

the DT

By y IN

At IN

Faced ed VBN

( (

Mr. NNP

though IN

But CC
more RBR

the DT

which WDT

So IN
the DT

presents s VBZ
a DT
genuine JJ
puzzle NN

that WDT
reaches es VBZ

beyond IN

of IN

We PRP

To TO

with IN

we PRP

note VB
that IN
in IN

to TO
the DT

, ,

In IN

of IN

We PRP

Mr. NNP

as s IN
we PRP

Unlike IN

The DT

We PRP

Perhaps s RB
the DT

We PRP

that IN
Mr. NNP

the DT

because IN
of IN

that IN

Somewhere RB

perhaps s RB

The DT

Mr. NNP

In IN

the DT

For or IN

Perhaps s RB

Alan NNP

adds s VBZ
his s PRP$

that IN

Those DT

who WP

that IN

to TO

the DT

Mr. NNP
Reynolds s NNP
also RB
notes es VBZ
that IN
since IN

no DT

are VBP
less s RBR

We PRP
would MD
add VB
that IN
in IN

, ,
Mrs. NNP

's s POS

was s VBD
failing ing VBG

In IN

neither er DT

we PRP

In IN

`` ``

it PRP

an DT

All PDT

more RBR
so RB
when en WRB

Better er JJR

just RB
for or IN

So IN
Mr. NNP

In IN

that WDT

What WP

Our PRP$

this s DT
: :

( (
which WDT

This s DT
put VBD

The DT

of IN

is s VBZ
one CD
of IN
those DT

that WDT

If IN

, ,
the DT

would MD
have VB
been en VBN
unable able JJ
to TO
cut VB
their PRP$
exorbitant JJ

The DT
reason NN
is s VBZ
simple JJ

When en WRB
a DT

tax NN

, ,
it PRP
makes es VBZ
itself PRP
more RBR
attractive ive JJ
to TO

and CC
drives es VBZ
up RP
the DT

It PRP
was s VBD
fear NN
of IN
disturbing ing VBG

that WDT
caused ed VBD

Edouard NNP

that IN

would MD
be VB
criticized ed VBN

anti-European JJ
for or IN
disturbing ing VBG

The DT
price NN
of IN
attracting ing VBG

-- :
whether er IN
one NN

that IN

Mr. NNP

This s DT
misguided ed JJ

Consequently ly RB

Mr. NNP

that IN

It PRP

that IN

The DT

that IN

that WDT

For or IN

Further er JJ

The DT

likely ly JJ

While IN
