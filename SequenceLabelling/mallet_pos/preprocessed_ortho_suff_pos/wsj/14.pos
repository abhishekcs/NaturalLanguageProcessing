that IN

The DT

A DT

the DT

Increased ed VBN

sense NN
because IN

For or IN

it PRP

But CC

they y PRP

that IN

`` ``

Foreign JJ

of IN

's s POS
big JJ
infrastructural al JJ
projects s NNS

been en VBN

of IN
the DT

on IN

Albert NNP
Lee NNP

a DT

who WP

in IN

estimates es VBZ
that IN

that WDT

'' ''
he PRP
says s VBZ

Even en RB
when en WRB
new JJ
lending ing NN
resumes es VBZ
, ,
foreign JJ

would MD
still RB
be VB
tight JJ
because IN
Beijing ing NNP

to TO

which WDT

grown VBN
between en IN
30 CD

40 CD

in IN
the DT
past JJ

And CC
foreign JJ
creditors s NNS
are VBP
likely ly JJ
to TO
be VB
more RBR
cautious ous JJ
about IN
extending ing VBG

because IN

nearing ing VBG
a DT

as s IN
many y JJ

start VBP
falling ing VBG
due JJ
in IN
the DT
next JJ
two CD
to TO
five ive CD
years s NNS
. .



Another er DT
reason NN
for or IN
the DT
intensity ity NN
of IN
the DT
trade NN
problems s NNS
is s VBZ
that IN
Beijing ing NNP
has s VBZ
extended ed VBN
the DT
current JJ
clampdown NN
on IN
imports s NNS
beyond IN
the DT
usual al JJ
target NN
of IN
consumer er NN
products s NNS
to TO
include VB
steel NN
, ,

and CC

These DT
have VBP
been en VBN
among IN

's s POS
leading ing VBG
imports s NNS
, ,
particularly ly RB
last JJ
year NN
when en WRB
there EX
were VBD
shortages es NNS

that WDT
led ed VBD
many y JJ
traders s NNS
to TO
buy y VB
heavily ly RB
and CC
pay y VB
dearly ly RB
. .



But CC
the DT
shortages es NNS
also RB
spawned ed VBD
rampant JJ
speculation ion NN
and CC
spiraling ing VBG
prices es NNS
. .

To TO
stem VB
speculation ion NN
, ,
Beijing ing NNP
imposed ed VBD
ceiling ing NN
prices es NNS

that WDT
went VBD
into IN
effect NN
earlier er RBR
this s DT
year NN
. .

Traders s NNS

who WP
had VBD
bought VBN
the DT
goods s NNS
at IN
prices es NNS
above IN
the DT

do VBP
n't RB
want VB
to TO
take VB
a DT

on IN

and CC
are VBP
holding ing VBG

their PRP$

. .

The DT
resulting ing VBG

has s VBZ
depressed ed VBN
the DT

But CC
Beijing ing NNP
ca MD
n't RB
cut VB

such JJ

the DT
question ion NN
faced ed VBN
by y IN

is s VBZ
: :
What WP
is s VBZ
UAL NNP
stock NN
worth NN
? .



The DT
short JJ
answer er NN
, ,
on IN
a DT
fundamental al JJ
basis s NN
, ,
is s VBZ
that IN
airline NN
analysts s NNS
say y VBP
the DT
stock NN
is s VBZ
worth JJ
somewhere RB
between en IN
$ $
135 CD
and CC
$ $
150 CD

a DT
share NN
. .

That DT
's s VBZ
based ed VBN
on IN
a DT
multiple NN
of IN
anywhere RB
between en IN
8.5 CD
to TO
10 CD
times es NNS
UAL NNP

, ,
which WDT
are VBP
estimated ed VBN
to TO
come VB
in IN
somewhere RB
around IN
$ $
16 CD

a DT
share NN

this s DT
year NN
. .



Airline NN
stocks s NNS
typically ly RB
sell VBP
at IN
a DT
discount NN
of IN
about IN
one-third NN
to TO
the DT
stock NN
market NN
's s POS
price-earnings s NNS
ratio NN
-- :
which WDT
is s VBZ
currently ly RB
about IN
13 CD
times es NNS
earnings s NNS
. .

That DT
's s VBZ
because IN
airline NN
earnings s NNS
, ,
like IN
those DT
of IN
auto NN
makers s NNS
, ,
have VBP
been en VBN
subject JJ
to TO
the DT
cyclical al JJ
ups-and-downs s NNS
of IN
the DT

. .



That DT
analysis s NN
matches es VBZ
up RB
with IN
stock NN
traders s NNS
' POS
reports s NNS
that IN
, ,
despite IN
the DT
huge JJ
drop NN
in IN
the DT

UAL NNP

n't RB

it PRP
could MD
attract VB
buying ing NN
by y IN

solely ly RB
on IN
the DT
basis s NN
of IN
earnings s NNS
. .



So CC
anyone NN
buying ing VBG
the DT
stock NN
now RB
is s VBZ
betting ing VBG
on IN
some DT
special al JJ
transaction ion NN
such JJ
as s IN
a DT

or or CC

and CC
must MD

One CD
