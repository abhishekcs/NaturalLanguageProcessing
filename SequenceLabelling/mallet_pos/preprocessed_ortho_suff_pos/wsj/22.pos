After er IN

The DT

If IN

The DT

is s VBZ
that IN

the DT

that IN

The DT

what WP

Enough JJ

as s IN
it PRP

in IN

in IN

thereby y RB
crippling ing VBG

The DT

It PRP

that DT
temporarily ly RB
but CC
it PRP

These DT
two CD
myths s NNS
have VBP
caused ed VBN
the DT

untold JJ
damage NN

The DT

took VBD

an DT
inflationary y JJ

when en WRB

an DT
incredible ible JJ

in IN
August NNP
1971 CD
, ,
thereby y RB
discouraging ing VBG

. .

Jimmy y NNP
Carter er NNP
ultimately ly RB
hired ed VBD
Mr. NNP
Volcker er NNP
to TO
kill VB

, ,
which WDT
was s VBD

. .

He PRP
did VBD
, ,
too RB

Mr. NNP

from IN

. .



But CC
all DT
that DT
was s VBD
a DT
long JJ
time NN
ago RB
and CC
politicians s NNS
have VBP
a DT
way y NN
of IN
forgetting ing VBG
such JJ
things s NNS
. .

The DT
1970s s NNS
inflation ion NN
yielded ed VBD
great JJ
benefits s NNS
to TO
some DT
producer er NN
interests s NNS
, ,
including ing VBG
Arab JJ
sheiks s NNS
, ,
at IN
the DT
expense NN
of IN
the DT
American JJ
middle NN

It PRP
was s VBD
a DT
classic ic JJ
example NN
of IN
how WRB
inflation ion NN
transfers s VBZ
income NN
to TO
the DT
wealthy y JJ
from IN
the DT
middle JJ

That DT
explains s VBZ
why y WRB
there EX
are VBP
always s RB
powerful ful JJ
political al JJ
interests s NNS
pushing ing VBG
for or IN
a DT
soft JJ
currency y NN
. .

In IN
some DT

, ,
those DT

have VBP
overwhelmed ed VBN
the DT
government ment NN
and CC
what WP
remains s VBZ
of IN
a DT
middle JJ

. .



The DT
claim NN

that IN
inflation ion NN
generates es VBZ
economic ic JJ
growth NN
is s VBZ
seductive ive JJ
. .

In IN
fact NN

it PRP
does es VBZ
the DT
opposite NN
. .

As s IN
the DT
charts s NNS
show VBP
, ,
the DT
1975-80 CD
inflation ion NN
destroyed ed VBD
both DT
productivity ity NN
and CC
economic ic JJ
growth NN
( (
see VB
accompanying ing VBG
charts s NNS
-- :
WSJ NNP
Oct. NNP

. .

It PRP
was s VBD
only ly RB
after er IN
Mr. NNP
Volcker er NNP
killed ed VBD
inflation ion NN
, ,
at IN
the DT
cost NN
of IN
a DT
sharp JJ
but CC
brief JJ
recession ion NN
, ,
that IN
growth NN
and CC
productivity ity NN
started ed VBD
rising ing VBG
once RB
more RBR
. .

Producers s NNS
were VBD
forced ed VBN
by y IN
the DT
discipline NN
of IN

to TO
slash VB
away y RB
organizational al JJ

and CC
acquire VB
more RBR

After er IN
having ing VBG
performed ed VBD
that DT
admirable able JJ
feat NN
, ,
however er RB
, ,
they y PRP
were VBD
back RB
in IN
1985 CD
demanding ing VBG
a DT

that WDT
would MD
make VB
it PRP
still RB
easier er RBR
for or IN
them PRP
to TO

in IN

They y PRP

and CC
, ,
as s IN
is s VBZ
usually ly RB
the DT

, ,
began VBD
picking ing VBG

again RB

So RB
now RB
they y PRP
want VBP
another er DT

Many y JJ
corporate JJ

do VBP
n't RB
understand VB
or or CC
do VBP
n't RB
want VB
to TO
understand VB
that IN
their PRP$

of IN

That DT
was s VBD
reflected ed VBN
in IN
the DT
stagnant JJ

of IN

Productivity ity NN

As s IN
in IN

this s DT

In IN

In IN
another er DT
similarity ity NN
to TO

the DT
government ment NN
was s VBD
threatening ing VBG
a DT

2.5 CD

that WDT

rising ing VBG
for or IN
most JJS

Another er DT
difference NN

this s DT

is s VBZ
that DT

much RB
lower er JJR

which WDT

that IN

In IN

the DT

and CC

Friday y NNP
at IN
13 CD

On IN
the DT
other er JJ
hand NN
, ,
one CD
reason NN
those DT
ratios s NNS
were VBD
so RB
high JJ
in IN

was s VBD
that IN

As s IN
they y PRP

to TO

what WP
had VBD
gone VBN

, ,
the DT

quickly ly RB
discovered ed VBD
that IN
one CD
of IN
the DT
big JJ
roadblocks s NNS
had VBD
been en VBN
Japanese JJ

Although IN
they y PRP

just RB
a DT
few JJ
months s NNS
before IN

Japanese JJ

had VBD
said VBD

The DT
Japanese NNS
apparently ly RB
balked ed VBD
at IN
several al JJ
aspects s NNS
of IN
the DT

A DT
senior or JJ
executive ive NN
at IN
one CD
of IN
Japan NNP
's s POS
biggest est JJS

says s VBZ
the DT
UAL NNP

`` ``

all DT

that IN

working ing VBG
off RP

straight RB
up RB

So RB
where WRB
's s VBZ
the DT

? .

'' ''


Japanese JJ
lenders s NNS
also RB
recently ly RB
have VBP
grown VBN
more RBR
conservative ive JJ
toward IN
highly ly RB
leveraged ed JJ
transactions s NNS
, ,
partly ly RB
because IN
of IN
the DT

Japanese JJ

are VBP
worried ed VBN
that IN
the DT
government ment NN
might MD
issue VB
restrictive ive JJ
guidelines es NNS
unless s IN
the DT
banks s NNS
hold VBP
down RB
the DT

of IN

says s VBZ
a DT
Japanese JJ

official al NN

`` ``
So RB
, ,
they y PRP
are VBP
very y RB
cautious ous JJ
, ,
'' ''
he PRP
says s VBZ
. .



A DT
third JJ
problem NN
was s VBD
the DT
potential al NN
for or IN
labor or NN
unrest est NN
at IN
UAL NNP
, ,
something ing NN

that WDT
makes es VBZ
the DT
Japanese NNS
particularly ly RB
skittish JJ
. .

The DT
Japanese JJ
banks s NNS
were VBD
reminded ed VBN
of IN
the DT
labor or NN
tensions s NNS
at IN
UAL NNP

all RB
last JJ

. .

On IN
Wednesday y NNP
, ,
the DT

asked ed VBD
the DT

On IN

at IN
their PRP$
national al JJ

in IN

machinists s NNS
union ion NN
leaders s NNS
discussed ed VBD
launching ing VBG
an DT
allout JJ
campaign NN
against IN
UAL NNP
Chairman NNP
Wolf NNP
specifically ly RB
. .

The DT
machinists s NNS
have VBP
opposed ed VBN
the DT
buy-out NN
because IN
they y PRP
were VBD
n't RB
invited ed VBN
to TO
participate VB
in IN
the DT

and CC
because IN
they y PRP
fear VBP
all DT

that WDT

in IN

Machinists s NNS

John NNP

also RB
made VBD
the DT

's s POS
views s NNS
known VBN
in IN
telephone NN
conversations s NNS
with IN
representatives es NNS
of IN
Mitsubishi NNP
Bank NNP
, ,
one CD
of IN
the DT
Japanese JJ
banks s NNS

that WDT
was s VBD
considering ing VBG
participating ing VBG
in IN
the DT
financing ing NN
. .

In IN
those DT
conversations s NNS
, ,
he PRP
reiterated ed VBD
the DT

that IN
it PRP
would MD

significant JJ

in IN
the DT
round NN
of IN

The DT
Japanese JJ
banks s NNS
, ,
however er RB
, ,
were VBD
n't RB
the DT
only ly JJ
ones es NNS
worried ed JJ
. .

At IN
First NNP
Chicago NNP
, ,
executives es NNS
were VBD
sharply ly RB
divided ed VBN
on IN
whether er IN
the DT

should MD
participate VB

and CC
what WP
consequences es NNS

there EX
would MD
be VB
if IN
it PRP
rejected ed VBD
its s PRP$
longtime JJ

. .



Among IN
other er JJ
things s NNS
, ,
the DT
bank NN
feared ed VBD
`` ``
we PRP
'd MD
look VB
like IN

'' ''
if IN

was s VBD
able able JJ
to TO
piece VB

the DT

and CC

a DT

United ed NNP
's s POS
Mr. NNP

was s VBD
warning ing VBG
that IN

`` ``

As s IN
the DT
Thursday y NNP

for or IN

neared ed VBD

some DT

officers s NNS
at IN
First NNP

remained ed VBD
in IN

of IN
joining ing VBG
the DT

group NN
, ,
but CC
the DT

's s POS
`` ``

were VBD
opposed ed VBN

citing ing VBG
the DT
high JJ

of IN

associated ed VBN
with IN
the DT

A DT

of IN

Chairman NNP

Thursday y NNP
morning ing NN
was s VBD
strongly ly RB
against IN
the DT

. .



One CD
official al NN
close JJ
to TO
the DT
transaction ion NN
said VBD
banks s NNS
were VBD
worried ed VBN
about IN
the DT
amount NN
of IN

the DT

had VBD
to TO

He PRP

In IN
the DT

however er RB

a DT

less s JJR
than IN
$ $
1 CD
in IN

for or IN
every y DT

of IN

Another er DT
problem NN
: :
The DT
buy-out NN
group NN
's s POS
financial al JJ
projections s NNS
did VBD
n't RB
assume VB
any y DT
type NN
of IN

in IN
the DT
near JJ

For or IN

, ,
the DT

projected ed VBD
that DT

would MD
increase VB
nearly ly RB
10 CD
% NN
annually ly RB
over er IN
the DT
next JJ
few JJ
years s NNS
. .

It PRP
estimated ed VBD
that IN
yields s NNS
-- :
the DT
amount NN
of IN

the DT

-- :

increase VB
an DT

a DT

, ,
despite IN
the DT
ups s NNS
and CC
downs s NNS
the DT
industry y NN
has s VBZ
suffered ed VBN
in IN
the DT
last JJ
10 CD
years s NNS

The DT
projections s NNS
also RB
assumed ed VBD
that IN
load NN

-- :
the DT

66.7 CD
% NN
or or CC
thereabouts s RB
, ,
even en RB
though IN

has s VBZ
been en VBN
weakening ing VBG

According ing VBG
to TO
a DT
machinists s NNS
union ion NN
analysis s NN
of IN
the DT

that WDT

be VB
presented ed VBN
to TO

in IN
the DT

Clearly ly RB

any y DT

that WDT
