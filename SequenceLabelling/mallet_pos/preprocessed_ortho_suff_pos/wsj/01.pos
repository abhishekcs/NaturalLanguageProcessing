the DT

If IN

Mr. NNP

The DT

Mr. NNP

The DT
prevailing ing VBG

of IN

that IN

This s DT

As s IN

understand VBP
, ,
a DT
`` ``

so RB

emasculate VB

It PRP

The DT

the DT

a DT

( (

Yet RB
Section ion NNP

of IN
the DT

: :
`` ``

'' ''
Thus s RB

with IN
one CD

in IN

repeals s VBZ

the DT

Section ion NN

also RB
imposes es VBZ
unconstitutional al JJ
conditions s NNS
on IN
the DT
president NN
's s POS
ability ity NN
to TO
nominate VB

of IN

The DT
language NN
of IN
the DT

implies ies VBZ
that IN
any y DT

to TO
any y DT

of IN
a DT
rejected ed VBN

will MD
result VB
in IN
the DT

being ing VBG
denied ed VBN

that DT

The DT

probably ly RB
not RB
avoid VB
this s DT
restriction ion NN
by y IN
choosing ing VBG
people NNS
willing ing JJ

, ,
because IN
the DT
Anti-Deficiency y NNP

The DT
1990 CD
appropriations s NNS

also RB
contain VBP
a DT
number er NN
of IN
`` ``

provisions s NNS

that WDT
violate VBP
the DT

clause NN
in IN
Article NNP
II NNP
of IN
the DT

Muzzling ing JJ
provisions s NNS
, ,
which WDT
might MD
be VB
called ed VBN
`` ``

'' ''
as s IN
well RB
, ,
prevent VBP

even en RB
looking ing VBG
at IN

, ,
let VB

from IN

Such JJ

violate VBP
the DT
provision ion NN
in IN
Article NNP
II NNP

that WDT
requires es VBZ
the DT

to TO
make VB

to TO

which WDT
gives es VBZ
the DT

the DT
discretion ion NN
to TO
select VB
the DT
subject JJ

of IN
those DT

. .



Typically ly RB
, ,
these DT

seek VBP
to TO
prevent VB

make VBP

or or CC
proposing ing VBG
more JJR
market-oriented ed JJ

Probably ly RB
the DT
most RBS
egregious ous JJ
example NN
is s VBZ
a DT
proviso NN
in IN
the DT

bill NN
for or IN
the DT

that WDT

There EX

something ing NN
inherently ly RB

Perhaps s RB
none NN

contained ed VBN
in IN
the DT

fiscal al JJ
1990 CD
better er RBR

Congress s NNP

Section ion NN
609 CD
of IN

The DT

in IN
INS NNP
v. CC

that IN

President NNP

By y IN

though IN

If IN

unworkable able JJ
because IN

that WDT

The DT

in IN

that WDT

There EX

If IN

In IN

If IN

One CD
such JJ

an DT

Another er DT

a DT

the DT

the DT

of IN

when en WRB

But CC
in IN

what WP

Reducing ing VBG

An DT

it PRP

A DT

cause VB

when en WRB

Arbitrage NN
simply ly RB

The DT

Perhaps s RB
he PRP

In IN

this s DT

If IN

Volatility ity NN

but CC
because IN

The DT

because IN

If IN

the DT

The DT
