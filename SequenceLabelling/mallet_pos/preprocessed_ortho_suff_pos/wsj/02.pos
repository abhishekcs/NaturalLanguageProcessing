What WP

the DT

more JJR

The DT
SEC NNP
's s POS
Mr. NNP

vehemently ly RB
disputed ed VBD
those DT

The DT

the DT

And CC
some DT

that IN

These DT

are VBP
attractive ive JJ
to TO
Japanese JJ

for or IN
three CD
reasons s NNS

First LS
, ,
they y PRP

While IN

n't RB
backed ed VBN
by y IN
the DT
full JJ
faith NN
and CC
credit NN
of IN
the DT
U.S. NNP

, ,
as s IN

, ,
it PRP
is s VBZ
widely ly RB
assumed ed VBN
that IN

if IN

( (

still RB
the DT
dollar-denominated ed JJ

of IN
choice NN
for or IN
long-term JJ
Japanese JJ

) )
. .

Second LS
, ,
they y PRP
are VBP
liquid JJ
. .

The DT
secondary y JJ
market NN
in IN
federally ly RB
backed ed JJ
mortgage NN
securities ies NNS
now RB
exceeds s VBZ
$ $
900 CD
billion ion CD
, ,
or or CC
nearly ly RB
half NN
of IN
the DT
$ $
2.2 CD
trillion ion CD
in IN
U.S. NNP
residential al JJ
mortgages es NNS

Third LS
, ,
they y PRP
offer er VBP
high JJ
yields s NNS
. .

At IN
the DT
moment ment NN
, ,
some DT
offer er VBP
as s RB
much JJ
as s IN
1.6 CD

percentage NN

over er IN

But CC
there EX
is s VBZ
a DT
risk NN
, ,
which WDT

the DT
Japanese NNPS
discovered ed VBD
when en WRB
they y PRP
first RB
dipped ed VBD
their PRP$
toes es NNS
into IN
the DT
market NN
nearly ly RB
five ive CD
years s NNS
ago RB
. .

Since IN
most JJS
mortgages es NNS
can MD
be VB
prepaid VBN
or or CC
refinanced ed VBN
at IN
any y DT
time NN
, ,
issuers s NNS
of IN
mortgage NN
securities ies NNS
retain VBP
the DT
right NN
to TO
buy y VB
back RB
their PRP$
bonds s NNS
before IN
maturity ity NN
. .

That DT
's s VBZ
a DT
headache NN
for or IN
long-term JJ
investors s NNS
, ,
since IN
it PRP
forces es VBZ
them PRP
to TO

their PRP$
money y NN
-- :
usually ly RB
at IN
lower er JJR
rates es NNS
than IN
the DT
original al JJ
mortgage NN

carried ed VBD

`` ``
Two CD
or or CC
three CD

the DT

Compounding ing VBG
the DT

to TO
Japanese JJ
investors s NNS

monthly ly RB
, ,
since IN

investors s NNS

so IN

As s IN

, ,

But CC
they y PRP
did VBD
n't RB
lose VB

with IN

U.S. NNP

Since IN

that IN

of IN

that WDT

and CC
automatically ly RB

so IN

Freddie NNP

As s IN

uninvited ed JJ

still RB
alive ive JJ
despite IN

Therefore RB
, ,
the DT

about IN

continue VB
to TO

in IN

of IN

Although IN

in IN
different JJ

they y PRP

by y IN

's s POS

if IN
they y PRP
approve VBP
of IN

Supporters s NNS
of IN

argue VBP
that DT

, ,

put VBN
in IN
a DT
better er JJR

to TO

the DT
long-term JJ

of IN

Recent JJ
studies ies NNS
by y IN
Georgeson NNP

conclude VBP
that IN

with IN

have VBP
experienced ed VBN
greater er JJR
stock-price JJ

than IN
corporations s NNS
without IN
poison NN
pills s NNS
during ing IN
the DT
past JJ
few JJ

Critics s NNS
of IN
poison NN
pills s NNS
argue VBP
that IN
they y PRP
harm VBP

by y IN
letting ing VBG

by y IN
deterring ing VBG
premium JJ

from IN
ever er RB

These DT
critics s NNS
are VBP
backed ed VBN
by y IN
several al JJ
academic ic JJ

showing ing VBG
that IN
the DT

of IN

reduces es VBZ

not RB
merely ly RB
in IN
the DT
short JJ

, ,
but CC
also RB
over er IN
longer er JJR
periods s NNS

Institutional al JJ

that WDT

on IN
a DT

are VBP

less s RBR
in IN

than IN
in IN
the DT

Does es VBZ

If IN

However er RB

that DT

The DT

rather er RB

it PRP

Assume VB

There EX

no DT

The DT

was s VBD
non-violent JJ

only ly RB
a DT
simple JJ

, ,
but CC
its s PRP$
impact NN
on IN
that DT

and CC

Assume VB
that IN
a DT

a DT

The DT

recently ly RB
generated ed VBN
a DT

of IN

amid IN

In IN
a DT

several al JJ

that IN

The DT

The DT

It PRP

alleged ed VBN
that DT

done VBN
more JJR
than IN

to TO

so RB
the DT

Let VB
us s PRP

at IN
another er DT

of IN

that WDT

I PRP

Their PRP$

which WDT

they y PRP

they y PRP

Even en RB

It PRP

it PRP

Under er IN

The DT

who WP

if IN

Finally ly RB

I PRP

it PRP

to TO

This s DT
