this s DT

how WRB

But CC
the DT
broader er JJR

Mr. NNP

until IN
Mr. NNP
Bush NNP
told VBD

at IN

It PRP

ironic ic JJ
that IN

should MD
be VB
in IN

A DT

who WP

in IN

`` ``

who WP

`` ``

that WDT

Maine NNP

William NNP
Cohen en NNP
said VBD
the DT

So RB
the DT

By y IN

when en WRB

rejected ed VBD
a DT

more RBR
modest est JJ

even en RB

Mr. NNP

does es VBZ

think VB
all PDT
this s DT

the DT

this s DT

but CC
he PRP

that IN

`` ``

Writing ing VBG

he PRP

that IN

only ly RB
when en WRB

a DT
`` ``

what WP

`` ``

he PRP

`` ``

`` ``

successful ful JJ

Because IN
it PRP
had VBD

'' ''


Mr. NNP
Boren en NNP
is s VBZ
confusing ing VBG
consensus s NN
on IN
general al JJ

with IN

on IN

Elliott NNP
Abrams s NNP

a DT

that WDT

would MD
have VB

if IN

Mr. NNP

The DT

what WP

that WDT

One CD

In IN

that IN

I PRP

The DT

if IN

at IN

all DT

I PRP

But CC
, ,
I PRP

it PRP

that IN
the DT

of IN
the DT

is s VBZ
flawed ed VBN
and CC
the DT

is s VBZ
not RB

to TO

The DT
conceptual al JJ

-- :
a DT
criminal-justice NN
approach NN
-- :
is s VBZ
the DT
same JJ
that IN
I PRP
have VBP
worked ed VBN
through IN
before RB
, ,
in IN
the DT
Nixon NNP

when en WRB
I PRP

budget NN

of IN

We PRP

we PRP
worked ed VBD
hard RB
on IN

In IN
the DT
Reagan NNP

we PRP

a DT

; :
we PRP

very y RB
hard RB
on IN

Our PRP$
international al JJ
efforts s NNS
were VBD
far RB
greater er JJR
than IN
ever er RB
before RB

You PRP

looking ing VBG
at IN
a DT

whose WP$
motorcade NN
was s VBD
attacked ed VBN

the DT

, ,
so IN
I PRP
'm VBP
personally ly RB
a DT
veteran NN
of IN
this s DT

What WP

we PRP
have VBP
before IN
us s PRP
now RB
is s VBZ
essentially ly RB
the DT
same JJ

but CC
with IN
more JJR
resources es NNS
plowed ed VBN
into IN
all DT
of IN
the DT
efforts s NNS
to TO
enforce VB
and CC
control VB
. .

These DT
efforts s NNS
wind VBP
up RB
creating ing VBG
a DT
market NN
where WRB
the DT
price NN
vastly ly RB
exceeds s VBZ
the DT
cost NN
. .

With IN
these DT
incentives es NNS
, ,
demand NN
creates es VBZ
its s PRP$
own JJ
supply ly NN
and CC
a DT
criminal al JJ
network NN
along IN
with IN
it PRP

It PRP
seems s VBZ
to TO
me PRP

we PRP
're VBP
not RB
really ly RB
going ing VBG
to TO
get VB
anywhere RB
until IN
we PRP
can MD
take VB
the DT
criminality ity NN
out IN
of IN
the DT
drug NN
business ness NN
and CC
the DT
incentives es NNS
for or IN
criminality ity NN
out IN
of IN
it PRP
. .

Frankly ly RB
, ,
the DT
only ly JJ
way y NN

I PRP
can MD
think VB
of IN
to TO
accomplish VB
this s DT
is s VBZ
to TO
make VB
it PRP
possible ible JJ
for or IN
addicts s NNS
to TO
buy y VB
drugs s NNS
at IN
some DT
regulated ed JJ
place NN
at IN
a DT
price NN

that WDT
approximates es VBZ
their PRP$
cost NN
. .

When en WRB
you PRP
do VBP
that IN
you PRP
wipe VBP
out RP
the DT
criminal al JJ
incentives es NNS
, ,
including ing VBG
, ,
I PRP
might MD
say y VB
, ,
the DT
incentive ive NN
that IN
the DT
drug NN
pushers s NNS
have VBP
to TO
go VB
around RP
and CC
get VB
kids s NNS
addicted ed VBN
, ,
so IN
that IN
they y PRP
create VBP
a DT
market NN
for or IN
themselves es PRP
. .

They y PRP
wo MD
n't RB
have VB
that DT
incentive ive NN
because IN
they y PRP
wo MD
n't RB
have VB
that DT

. .



So RB
I PRP
think VBP
the DT
conceptual al JJ

needs s VBZ
to TO
be VB
thought VBN
out RB
in IN
a DT
different JJ

If IN

it PRP
